Installation instructions for nftables
======================================

 Prerequisites
 =============

  - build tooling: glibc headers, gcc, autotools, automake, libtool, pkg-config.

  - libmnl: git://git.netfilter.org/libmnl.git

  - libnftnl: git://git.netfilter.org/libnftnl.git

  - flex

  - bison

  - libgmp: alternatively, see mini-gmp support below.

  - libreadline or libedit or linenoise: required by interactive command line

  - optional: libxtables: required to interact with iptables-compat

  - optional: libjansson: required to build JSON support

  - optional: asciidoc: required for building man-page

  - optional: fpm: required for building deb or rpm packages
  	(See https://fpm.readthedocs.io/en/v1.15.1/index.html)

 Configuring and compiling
 =========================

 Run "sh autogen.sh" to generate the configure script, then:

 sh configure [options]

 --prefix=

        The prefix to put all installed files under. It defaults to
        /usr/local, so the binaries will go into /usr/local/bin, sbin,
        manpages into /usr/local/share/man, etc.

 --datarootdir=

	The base directory for arch-independent files. Defaults to
	$prefix/share.

 --disable-debug

	Disable debugging

 --with-mini-gmp

	Use builtin mini-gmp instead of linking with a shared libgmp.
	This is useful for embedded platforms optimizing for size and
	having no other use for libgmp.
	Note: This decreases the debugging verbosity in some files.

 --with-xtables

	For libxtables support to interact with the iptables-compat
	utility.

 --without-cli

	To disable interactive command line support, ie. -i/--interactive.

 --with-cli=readline

	To enable interactive command line support with libreadline.

 --with-cli=linenoise

	To enable interactive command line support with linenoise.

 --with-cli=editline

	To enable interactive command line support with libedit.

 --with-json

	To enable JSON support, this requires libjansson.

 --with-build-deb

	To enable build with deb package

 --with-build-rpm

	To enable build with rpm package

 --with-pkgdst=

	Path where the package will be installed. By default all will be installed
	into path determinated by the --prefix option

 Run "make" to compile nftables, "make install" to install it in the
 configured paths. Before running make you may need to determinate pkgconfig path
 for the libnftnl library installed early
 (e.g. export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/swarm/lib/pkgconfig/)

 Configuration with package
 ==========================
 To enable build a package just configure one of the option:
	./configure --with-build-deb
	make build-deb
	or
	./configure --with-build-rpm
	make build-rpm
 If you need to install a package to a specific location
 you have to specify the path using the --with-pkgdst option:
	./configure --with-pkgdst=/opt/swarm/ --with-build-deb
	make build-deb

 Python support
 ==============

 CPython bindings are available for nftables under the py/ folder.  They can be
 installed using pip:

	python -m pip install py/

 A legacy setup.py script can also be used:

	( cd py && python setup.py install )

 However, this method is deprecated.
